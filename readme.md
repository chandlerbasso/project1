<h1> USER STORY</h1>
as a wdi student im going to use jquery and java script to make a side scrolling "shooter" that will either be time or point based(depending on what my skills allow) that will have several objects/pictures/gifs sliding across the screen at varying speeds clicking them will destroy them and it will log your score in either a points method or a time stamp that youll have to beat
